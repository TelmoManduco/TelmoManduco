### Hi, I'm Telmo Manduco ðŸ‘‹

I am a programming student, currently learning C# (visual studio), Python (PyCharm), 
though I do not mind learning other technologies if needed for my career or job offer.

### Right now

I am looking for student or beginner jobs, although I already have a lot of experience in various disciplines I have never worked in the field, but I am looking for opportunities to do so and improve professionally.
